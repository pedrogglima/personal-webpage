                    This is a small Ruby on Rails website to show informations
                    about the CBF (a brazillian soccer championship). To
                    accomplish that I schedule a job to scrap data from the CBF
                    official page regularly. The webpage also let you bet on the
                    score for the matches of the day. Some noticeable features
                    of this project are:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
                    <li>
                      Because the scraped data doesn't change often, I manually
                      fetch the data on database and cache it on Redis. To be
                      more precisely, I cache the partial view with data. It's
                      very similar to how Rails cache partials, the difference
                      here is that I don't hit the database everytime to check
                      for updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I work with Active Storage to save the Team's flag. When
                      scraping data we save the URL for accessing the Team's
                      flag image. Later, using a Sidekiq job, we download it,
                      locally, and resize it, for performance reasons, then we
                      save on AWS S3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I use the framework StimulusJS to handle the library
                      SwiperJS to create sliders for the next/previous
                      championship's matches. While SwiperJS offers a great API
                      for working with sliders, it doesn't offer the logic to
                      load dynamically data to the sliders.

                    <li>
                      The website let you login with Twitter or Google accounts.
                      I also create an API, with api-key for login, to offer the
                      scraped data.

                    This project is a Ruby gem and complements the gem ScrapCbf.
                    It gets ScrapCbf's output and saves on database. Right now,
                    it only has support for the ORM Active Record. This project

                    it will let you name the models for the scraped entities,
                    rename the entities's attributes, delete the entities's
                    attributes and create or not database associations between

                }{" "}
                . This dataset was generated during a CTF contest (CTF is a
                cyber hacking competition that stand for Capture the Flag) in
                2008, and the winner team gave an interview explaning how they
                proceeded to hack the computers located on a private network and
                capture the flag. To apply the modularity algorithm on the
                dataset we had to create a{" "}

                  <Link

                using the alerts's IP address Source and Destiny. The result
                from applying the modularity algorithm on this graph, and with
                the help of an algorithm for visualizing graphs, we obtained the
                following image:

                Short description of the image: the vertices represent computers
                (we call them hosts for now on) and the edges the interactions
                among them. The colours are added by the algorithm for
                visualizing graphs and used to distinguish group of hosts with
                common interactions among them (these group are the result of
                applying the modularity algorithm to the graph). The vertices
                with high number of edges and isolated from the group of
                vertices are the hosts that were compromised or have experienced
                multiple attempts of attack.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Final, with the detailed interview given by the winner team of
                the CTF contest we could understand how the attacks and
                compromises were made, and, also, prove our hypotheses from
                solely analyzing the image of the graph. From the image we were
                able to identify the hosts that were compromised and the ones
                under attack. A real-time and interactively application using
                this technique would be able to show, visually, the
                chronological order of attacks and compromised hosts.

                Note 1.: I had to reduce the quality of the image because of the
                file size. Because of that, one edge is missing connecting the
                green vertice isolated and closest to the red vertices, to the
                red vertice isolated and centered between the group of red
                vertices and the group of red and purple vertices. This edge is
                important because it identify the first computer comprimised and
                the connection to the second one compromised.

                Note 2.: Because this is a small and no-interactive image, I had
                to remove the vertice's IP address from the the image. The IP
                addresses are useful to identify each computer on the network
                and, also, to discovery the compromised computers using the
                detailed interview given by the winner team of the CTF contest.
